# ONGB-chronic-absenteeism

A dual-scale data analysis project integrating national education datasets and Oakland student-level data to identify early signals of chronic absenteeism and inform data-driven intervention strategies.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Support

This project is supported by Oakland Natives Give Back (ONGB), a community-based organization founded in 2008 by Oakland-native Black women to empower local youth through innovative, community-first programs, and Wizearly, which provides an AI-driven early warning solution for chronic absenteeism.

### 1.2 Project Overview

 Conduct a comprehensive landscape analysis of chronic absenteeism trends at both national and local scales, specifically in Oakland Unified School District (OUSD). This dual-scale approach will establish both national evidence and local validation for understanding systemic absenteeism challenges, positioning ONGB's programs and Wizearly's early-warning platform for local impact and national scalability.

### 1.3 Data Sources

1. ONGB will provide a dataset containing 7 years of Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) attendance records with 80,000 records (NDA required). 

2. Clinical records (Care Notes) from Wizearly platform containing student mental health and social indicators.

3. Expecting to incorporate additional factors such as poverty levels, weather, and food accessibility data. 

### 1.4 Tools

1. Python or R programming

2. Data cleaning and manipulation (Pandas, NumPy, dplyr)

3. Statistical modeling and machine learning

4. Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, PowerBI)

5. SQL or database management

Communication through Slack and email.

### 1.5 Deliverables  

Part 1. National & Local Early-Signal Landscape Report 

Clean the data and decide how to handle the many missing components.

A comprehensive analysis identifying early indicators that consistently precede chronic absenteeism at both national and Oakland levels finalizing with a detailed report.

Part 2. Predictive Feature Library for Wizearly

A structured catalog of nationally relevant features for risk modeling, validated with OUSD data, including feature definitions, expected correlations, preliminary importance rankings, and performance metrics from Oakland student-level predictions

### 1.6 Project Timeline

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Data Acquisition & Exploration

Access and download national datasets (EdFacts/NCES, CRDC, Census ACS, state dashboards)
Receive and explore OUSD student-level dataset (thousands of records)
Establish representative district comparison set (100-300 districts across 10 states)
Initial exploratory data analysis of national trends (2018-2024) and Oakland-specific patterns

Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6): Data Integration & Feature Engineering

Clean and harmonize multi-source national datasets
Process and integrate OUSD granular student data
Develop early-signal taxonomy using Wizearly's IPIR framework (attendance patterns, academic dips, behavioral incidents, family engagement, basic needs, community factors)
Create intervention typology from documented district plans
Compare Oakland features with national data patterns

Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9): Statistical Modeling & Pattern Analysis

Conduct national-level regression and clustering analyses
Build predictive models using OUSD student-level data
Validate national patterns against Oakland findings
Identify geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic variation patterns
Perform geospatial analysis of district characteristics
Preliminary causal inference on intervention effectiveness

Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12): Synthesis & Deliverable Production

Build interactive dashboard prototype (national + Oakland drill-down)
Compile predictive feature library validated with local data
Write comprehensive landscape report synthesizing national and local findings
Develop strategic recommendations for ONGB/Wizearly
Document Oakland-specific insights for OUSD partnership

Phase 5 (Weeks 13-15): Refinement & Final Presentation

Incorporate feedback from ONGB, Wizearly, and OUSD stakeholders
Finalize all deliverables
Present findings to ONGB/Wizearly leadership and OUSD partners
